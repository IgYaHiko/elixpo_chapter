### Tech stack

Elixpo Art is built as a comprehensive full-stack application on **Next.js**.

- **Frontend**: Next.js (React 19), modern CSS, JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js (for a fast, scalable API)
- **Data & auth**: Firebase / Firebase Admin
- **AI integration**: Pollinations API, Groq, Google Generative AI, and other services
- **Package management**: npm

### Running this locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

> 💡 `npm run dev` launches the Next.js dev server. Some integrations use
> `concurrently` to start backend services alongside the frontend.

**Prerequisites**: Node.js 20.x and npm. You can skip the GitHub PAT (Personal
Access Token) configuration for basic local development.
